The subject tends to have violent outbursts during tests, their personality 
swings from calm to violent rage. This may be an effect of V2, as we have observed
this trait in other patients. Subject's outbursts seem to have worsened following 
XXXX's graduation. We are currently working on a drug to prevent swings on the 
field. 
Do not engage with 0486 when they are in this state.

Subject is almost ready for team training once drug is found. 0486's power will 
work well with codes 9638 and 6543.                                                            
0486 has not yet recovered completely from the graduation of XXXX and is not        
expected to do so in the near future. I suggest using 5490's power to erase the 
memories as this is continuing to hinder 0486's effectiveness.
